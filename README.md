Devise Autosigninable
=============
Devise Autosigninable adds functionality of auto sign in to your [devise][1] app.
Devise Autosigninable is compatibile with all default Devise modules.
If Lockable module is activated Devise Autosigninable uses Lockable functionality for failed attempts.
If user is blocked or not confirmed he can't sign in with Devise Autosigninable too.

Devise Autosigninable signs in a user based on an autosignin token (random hash with length 32).
If signed in user tries to sign in with Devise Autosigninable he will be sign out first and then go to sign in.
So if token is incorrect user will be signed out anyway.

Devise Autosigninable compatibile with Rails 5


Installation
-----------


* Add devise_autosigninable to Gemfile:

    `gem 'devise_autosigninable', '1.1.0'`

* Add :autosigninable to your Devise modules in model, for example:

    `devise :registerable, :authenticatable, :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable, :lockable, :autosigninable`

* Generate migration for autosigninable. It creates neccessary fields and fill already existed records.

    `rails g devise_autosigninable MODEL`

Replace MODEL by the class name you want to add devise, like User, Admin, etc

* Run rake command for generation autosignin tokens

   `rake devise:autosigninable:ensure[MODEL]`

Route and Helpers
-----------
Devise Autosigninable has two methods which help to generate url and link to auto sign in

    auto_signin_url_for(object)

and

    link_to_autosignin(object, title, options)


By default Devise Autosigninable uses `'/:object_id/autosignin/:autosignin_token'` route. For example, for User model:

    /users/1/autosignin/c6718d1a2ebea0f716cb62ad2375af64

Also route understands optional parameter "return_to" to redirect after sign in.

Rake tasks
-----------
Devise Autosigninable has two rake task which help to reset all autosignin_tokens

    rake devise:autosigninable:reset[User]

and generate all missed autosigninable tokens

    rake devise:autosigninable:ensure[User]


Features
-----------

Devise Autosigninable has functionality of exipering token after sign in. To use it add this to the end of devise determing in model:

    :autosignin_expire => true

For example:

    devise :authenticatable, :confirmable, :recoverable, :validatable, :autosigninable, :autosignin_expire => true



Devise Autosigninable adds method `autosigninable?` which detects need of generation autosignin token for record. It may be useful if you don't want to add
autosignin functionality for some records.
